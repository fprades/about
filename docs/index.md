Hello world! I'm a software developer/engineer. As you might have guess from the first two words.

Coding for a living since 2007. Including - _but not limited to_ - **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **Java** and ... _bash_? And many others I'm not ready to admit - or accept - as programming languages: **cmake**, **xslt**, _bash_(it belongs here!), ... enough said. Earlier 2007 version coded for fun mostly: C, javascript and of course **basic**.

**Experience**: Distributed computing, design and architecture, build systems, tests, migrations, finance.

**Tools**: git, cmake, make, nunit, pytest, jenkins, anaconda, ...

**Supported OSes**: Linux, Windows, Solaris _(deprecated)_

**Interests**: Developing cutting edge tools for humans with humans.
