    $ about fprades

Hello world! I'm a software developer engineer. As you might have guess from the first two words in this paragraph

Coding for a living since 2007. Including - _but not limited to_ - **C++**, **C#**, **Python**, **Java** and ... _bash_? And many others I'm not ready to admit - or accept - as programming languages: **cmake**, **xslt**, _bash_(it belongs here!), ... enough said. Earlier 2007 version coded for fun mostly: C, javascript and of course **basic**.

Over the years - on top of flexing my coding skills - I had the opportunity to lead projects and teams. Designing and building solutions mostly in distributed environments. Working across divisions to reach consensus and common goals to build performing and robust solutions.

**Experience**: Distributed computing, design and architecture, build systems, tests, migrations, finance.

**Tools**: git, cmake, make, nunit, pytest, jenkins, anaconda, ...

**Supported OSes**: Linux, Windows, Solaris _(deprecated)_

**Interests**: Developing cutting edge tools for humans with humans.
